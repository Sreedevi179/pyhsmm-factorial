TODO make a demo and readme :)

It's probably a good idea to check out this repository in the 'plugins' subdirectory of [pyhsmm](https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm):

```bash
cd pyhsmm/plugins
git clone git://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm-factorial.git factorial
```

The code is fully functional... see http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1365v2.pdf
